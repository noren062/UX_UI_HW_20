        <p class="Hi">It's Nice to Meet You!</p>
        <p class="bio">Hi, I'm Amanda! I'm a Minneapolis based UX Designer and Researcher. Growing up in Minnesota, I learned two things: how to bear the cold, and telling good stories. I use this talent in my work as UX Researcher.

        Specializing in UX Research and Design, I love sitting down with users and filling in what their side of the story looks like. With their help, I build a comprehensive understanding, and solve user problems before they become pain points. <br><br>
        
        To mention a few of the tools I use to get between point A and point B, my skills include; Figma, Miro, InVision, JIRA, Qualitative Interviews, & Project Management.
        
        Let's create something beautiful that makes the users' days a little brighter, together!</p>
